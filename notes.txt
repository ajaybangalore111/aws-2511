=============

    -> AWS - Amazon Web Services 

        -> Cloud Computing 

            -> Application has data 

                -> Data is in server (database,web, file storage etc )

                    -> Server 

                        -> Server is an machine where, Applications run 

                        -> Server is a computer system, that takes a request
                            and sends response 

                    -> Where is this Server ? 

                        -> Servers are hosted in Datacenters 

    -> Data Center 

        -> A data center is a building, a dedicated space within a building, 
        or a group of buildings used to house computer systems and 
        associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems.

    -> Physical Data Centers are Expensive & Hard To Maintain 

    -> Cloud Computing
    
        -> ‘The Cloud’ can also refer to Cloud computing is the 
        "on-demand" availability of compute power, database storage, 
        applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform 
        (AWS/AZURE/GCP/Oracle etc) via the "internet" with "pay-as-you-go" pricing.

        -> Cloud Computing is comparable to Online Ride Services 

    -> Cloud Offerings

        -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS 

            -> Hardware (2 cpu - 4 GB ram - 500 GB SSD)

        -> Platform As A Service - PAAS 

            -> Database Platform (MySQL Database, NoSQL Database, Java Application Platform)

        -> Software As A Service - SAAS 

            -> Direct Softwares (subscribe and pay)

        -> NOTE: Compare them to Online Ride Services like 
                    Uber: Bikes, Cars, Autos etc 


16th Dec 2025
=============

    -> Traditional Approach (Setting Up Application Infrastructure On Physical Datacenters)

        -> Amazon Ecommerce Application 

            -> Servers 
                +
            -> Storage 
                +
            -> Databases 
                +
            -> Networking 
                +
            -> Security 
                +
            -> etc 

    -> New Approach (Setting Up Application Infrastructure On Cloud Datacenters (AWS))

        -> Amazon Ecommerce Application 

            -> Servers      -   AWS EC2
                +                  +
            -> Storage      -   AWS S3 
                +                  +
            -> Databases    -   AWS RDS        ======>    Application
                +                  +
            -> Networking   -   AWS VPC 
                +                  +
            -> Security     -   AWS IAM
                +                  +
            -> etc          -   AWS etc 


    -> Application should have following characteristics (Four Pillars Of Cloud)

        -> Highly Available 

            -> High availability in AWS ensures that applications are 
                continuously accessible and operational

        -> Fault Tolerant 

            -> Fault tolerance in AWS refers to the ability of a system to 
                continue operating without interruption in the face of hardware failures

        -> Secured 

            -> Security in AWS refers to the measures taken to protect cloud resources, 
                data, and applications from unauthorized access.

        -> Scalable  

            -> Scalability in AWS refers to the ability of a system to handle 
                increasing workloads and accommodate growing demands. 


    -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS 

        -> AWS Global Infrastructure 

            -> Amazon Cloud Computing resources (servers, storage, databases etc) 
            are available across the world. 
            In simple terms if we see this https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/ 
            then Amazon Data Centers are available in different geographical locations.

        -> In terms of AWS, infrastructure is made up of 

            -> Regions 

            -> Availability Zones 

            -> Edge locations

        -> Regions

            -> Regions are designed to service AWS customers (or your users) 
                that are located closest to a region.

            -> Availability of Services are different for different AWS Regions.

            -> Price varies from region to region

17th Dec 2025
=============

    -> Availability zone (AZ)

        -> Availability zone is where the actual data centers are located

        -> Within a Region, there can be multiple Availability zones

        -> Each AZ has independent Power Supply, Networking, Cooling System, Physical Security.

        -> https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan_Beres/publication/360541079/figure/fig1/AS:1154856056291328@1652350548135/AWS-Regions-and-Availability-Zones-Scott-nd.ppm

    
    -> Edge locations

        -> An AWS Edge Location is a data center in the AWS global network used by services 
        like CloudFront, Global Accelerator, and Lambda@Edge to store cached content 
        (images, videos) and process requests closer to end-users, 
        drastically reducing latency by serving data from the nearest point of presence(pop) 
        rather than a distant main AWS Region. 
        They act as caching warehouses, improving performance for websites.

    -> VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

        -> A Virtual Private Cloud is a secure, isolated private cloud hosted 
        within a public cloud. 

        -> VPC customers can run code, store data, host websites & applications in isolated mode

        -> NOTE: Having VPC is similar to having your own data center inside AWS. 

        -> VPC is a service that lets customers(IBM) provision a logically isolated 
        section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources(Servers) 
        in a VIRTUAL NETWORK that you define.


18th Dec 2025
=============

    -> VPC Architecture Reference 

        -> https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFI8sqvP4xFFQ/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1700537758681?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=zE97TFGw5FQJEjUksqx7SohNsqqV57-IYQ_pj7K2M2U

    -> VPC components

        -> Internet Gateway (Gate For Building)

            -> An Internet Gateway must be attached to a VPC if the resources inside the VPC 
                need to connect to resources via the open internet.

        -> Subnets (Floors In Building)

            -> A subnet or sub network is an logical subdivision of an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

        -> Route Tables (Lift In Building)

            -> A route table contains a set of rules called routes, 
                that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

        -> Network Access Control List - NACL (Watchman For Floor)

            -> subnet-level firewall that acts as an optional security layer 

        -> Security Group (Watchman For Flat)

            -> server-level firewall which is mandatory 

19th Dec 2025
=============

    -> VPC Workflow 

        -> "To enable access to or from the internet to an instance(server) in a VPC subnet, 
        you must attach an Internet gateway to your VPC, 
        ensure that your subnet route table points to the Internet gateway and 
        ensure that instance has a public IP address, 
        and ensure that your network access control and security group rules 
        allow the relevant traffic to your instance" -- AWS

20th Dec 2025
=============

    -> VPC Workflow & Components Demo

        -> Detach Internet Gateway 

            -> Proceeding with this action will detach the internet gateway from VPC. 
            If you detach the internet gateway, resources in the VPC 
            cannot communicate with the internet. 
        
        -> Attach Internet Gateway 

            -> Attach an internet gateway to a VPC to enable the VPC to communicate with the internet. 

        -> Route Table & Subnet 

            -> RT connects to subnet and shows the network path 

            -> Inside RT We have routes 

                -> local - within vpc 
                -> internet route - outside vpc (removed)

                -> Adding back a proper route i.e internet route, will fix issue 

        -> NACL - Network Access Control List 

            -> Firewall on Subnet Level, allows all traffic 

            -> Let's modify NACL to block all traffic and verify connectivity 

                -> Select Instance -> Select Subnet -> Select NACL 

        -> Security Group 

            -> Firewall on Instance / Server Level

            -> Let's modify Security Group to block traffic 

            -> Select Instance -> Select Security -> Select Security group 

            -> Delete SSH Rule (This security group has no inbound rules)

            -> Add SSH Rule back and test connectivity


22nd Dec 2025
=============

    -> Subnet Reserved IP's 

    -> Web Subnet 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.15.255
        10.0.0.0: Network address.
        10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
        10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS for Amazon DNS server.
        10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.
        10.0.15.255: Network broadcast address.

        -> Useable Range : 10.0.0.4 - 10.0.15.254v

    -> Infrastructure As Code (IaC)

        -> Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers 
            through machine-readable definition files [CODE].

        -> Cloud Formation Template 

            -> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-formats.html 


30th Dec 2025
=============

    -> Server Management is done using service called EC2 

    -> EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

        -> EC2 allows users to rent virtual computers (Servers/Machines) on which 
            you can run your own computer applications.

    -> Server is a machine (computer)

    -> NOTE: Server in aws is referred as EC2 Instance / Instance

    -> Computer has hardware                        -> Server has Instance Type [cpu + ram]
        i3 / i5 / 4 GB RAM etc                          t2.micro, t2.medium, t2.large etc 

    -> Computer has hard disk                       -> Instance has EBS (Elastic Block) Storage
        250 GB / 500 GB / 1 TB                          250 GB / 500 GB / 1 TB                      
    
    -> Computer has network                         -> Instance has VPC 

    -> Compute has operating system                 -> Instance has AMI - Amazon Machine Image 

    -> Computer has Authentication                  -> Instance has Authentication
        username & password                             key pairs (public & private key)

    -> Computer has applications                    -> Instance has applications
        chrome / notepad etc                            myntra / flipkart / netflix etc 


    -> Web Server 

        -> A web server is computer software that accepts requests via HTTP 
            to distribute web content.
        
        -> NGINX Web Server is popular for hosting Web Sites & Web Applications 

        -> Login To Server With Key

            -> ssh -i aws.pem ubuntu@3.138.172.167

            -> chmod 400 aws.pem

            -> ssh -i aws.pem ubuntu@3.138.172.167

        -> Setup Web Server 

            -> sudo apt update -y 
            -> sudo apt install nginx -y 

        -> Deploy Application 

            -> Application Code - https://github.com/ravi2krishna/ecomm.git 

            -> Document Root: Location where website code is hosted /var/www/html 

                -> ls /var/www/html 
                -> sudo rm -r /var/www/html/* 
                -> ls /var/www/html 
                -> sudo git clone https://github.com/ravi2krishna/ecomm.git /var/www/html 
                -> ls /var/www/html 

    -> Storage 

        -> AWS provides three popular services for Storage
                -> Elastic Block Store (EBS)
                -> Elastic File System (EFS)
                -> Simple Storage Service (S3)

        -> Elastic Block Store (EBS) - Used for Server Storage (OS(ubuntu), Softwares(nginx))
            -> It cannot be shared across multiple zones i.e multiple data centers
        
        -> Elastic File System (EFS) - Used for file sharing across multiple zones 
            i.e multiple data centers, we cannot use for (OS(ubuntu), Softwares(nginx))
            performance is very good, so the cost is higher 

        -> Simple Storage Service (S3) - Used for internet storage i.e static assets 
            i.e images, videos, documents etc (huge in size), so we need low cost storage i.e S3 
            we cannot use for (OS(ubuntu), Softwares(nginx))

31st Dec 2025
=============

    -> Elastic Block Store (EBS) - Used for Server Storage (OS(ubuntu), Softwares(nginx))
            -> It cannot be shared across multiple zones i.e multiple data centers

    -> EBS Must have an Root Volume (OS Disk i.e Primary Disk)

    -> EBS Optionally can have an Additional Volumes (Secondary Disk)

    -> Based On the Zone, Volume will be created in the same zone where instance is launched


2nd Jan 2025
=============

    -> EBS - Limitations 

        -> Using EBS we cannot get the data directly across Multiple Availability Zones
        -> Using EBS we cannot connect to MULTIPLE INSTANCES at same time 
        -> With EBS Volumes, you can only scale up, but NO SCALING DOWN
        -> EBS Volumes can scale only up to TB's

    -> EFS - Elastic File System 

        -> Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) provides a simple, scalable 
            fully managed elastic NFS file system for AWS ec2 

        -> EFS can scale to petabytes in size

        -> Using EFS we can directly get the data across Multiple Availability Zones
        
        -> Using EFS we can connect to multiple instances at the same time

        -> EFS uses port "2049" for NFS file system, not for instances

        -> We cannot use EFS as a root volume

        -> Using EFS

3rd Jan 2025
=============

    -> S3 

        -> https://aws.amazon.com/s3/

        -> Object storage built to retrieve any amount of data from anywhere

        -> S3 Buckets

            -> Data is stored in Buckets, Buckets are the main storage containers of S3.

        -> S3 Objects

            -> Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. An Object is a file.

        -> You can store unlimited objects in a bucket but an object cannot exceed 5 TB

        -> By default, all buckets & objects are private.

        -> S3 provides high availability, Objects are redundantly stored on multiple devices 
            across multiple facilities ( Multiple AZ's)

        -> Storage Classes

            -> A Storage Class represents the classification assigned to each object in S3.

            -> Each storage class has different Storage cost
            
            -> https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/

        -> S3 Lifecycle Policy 

            -> An object lifecycle policy is a set of rules that automate the 
            transitioning of an object's storage class to a different storage class 
            (or deletion) based on specified time intervals.

        -> S3 Versioning 

            -> S3 versioning is a feature to manage and store versions of an object

            -> S3 versioning protects your data against accidental overrides and deletion.

        -> S3 Static Web hosting
            
            -> You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website.

    -> Database Storage 

    -> Before Databases we need to know concepts of Security 

    -> Database Often Hold Sensitive Information

    -> In terms of AWS Security 

        -> Identity Level - IAM Service 

        -> Datacenter Level - Advance Networking concepts

    -> AWS IAM 

        -> AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you 
            "securely control access" to AWS resources.

        -> IAM Users 
        -> IAM Groups 
        -> IAM Policies
        -> IAM Roles 

        -> IAM Users 

            -> Root User: The user created when you first create your AWS account 
                is called the "root" user -> your_name@mail.com -> registered with aws account 
                root user has FULL rights i.e no Restrictions 

            -> IAM User: represents an AWS user that you may create (in IAM), 
                who will have "varying degrees of access"(read/write) to the AWS account.
                By default IAM users will not have any permissions.
                IAM Users can access aws resources using 

                    -> AWS Management Console: Human Based with Browser Login - username & password 

                    -> AWS Programmatic Access: Softwares & Tools Based Login - access & secret key  

            -> IAM Policy

                -> A policy is an object in AWS that defines permissions. 


6th Jan 2025
=============

    -> Custom Policy: A policy created by user based on custom requirements 

    -> IAM Group: It's an logical collection of IAM Users, used for organizing 
            permissions in easy way.

=============

    -> Security For Instances

        -> So when we are talking about "increased security", what we want to focus on is, 
            placing of EC2 instances that are holding our data in "private subnets".
            
        -> However this causes some issues

            -> We cannot serve traffic from private instances as there is no route 
            to the open internet and also we cannot access or ssh into 
            EC2 instances that are in private subnets

                -> Solution for above is - Bastion Server / Jump Server 

            -> We cannot install/update the software on those Private EC2 instances.

                -> NAT Gateway / Natting 

        -> Bastion Host / Server 

            -> A Bastion Host is an EC2 instance that lives in a public subnet, 
            and is used as a "gateway" for traffic that is destined for instances 
            that live in private subnets.

            -> A bastion host acts as a "portal" to access EC2 instances 
            that are located in a private subnet.

8th Jan 2025
=============

    -> NAT Gateway 

        -> NAT Gateway allows resources in a private subnet to access the internet for
        (system updates, external database connections, wget calls, OS patch, etc).
